# Orbital Mechanics Toolbox

## Project Description
Found in this repository are a variety of functions for solving the Keplerian 2-Body problem, including but not limited to: frame conversions, conic state solvers, Hohmann transfer calculators, and Lambert solvers. Additionally, a class-based program containing orbital elements of primary celestial bodies in our solar system has been provided for easy access. 

## How to Use
All code is written and ran in MATLAB.

Both Toolbox.m and Celestial_Body.m are designed to be imported and used in another MATLAB program to reduce meanial calculations. The functions are capable of automatically performing quadrant checks if provided the proper inputs. 

## Credits
Equations of Motion derived from Professor Kathleen Howell's AAE 532 "Advanced Orbital Dynamics" lectures.
